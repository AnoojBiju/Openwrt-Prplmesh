  NOT_AUTHORIZED_THIS_LOCATION: 30 # Requested service not authorized in this location
  SERVICE_CHANGE_PRECLUDES_TS: 31 # TS deleted because QoS AP lacks sufficient bandwidth for this QoS STA due to a change in BSS service characteristics or operational mode (e.g., an HT BSS change from 40 MHz channel to 20 MHz channel)
  UNSPECIFIED_QOS_REASON: 32 # Disassociated for unspecified, QoS-related reason
  NOT_ENOUGH_BANDWIDTH: 33 # Disassociated because QoS AP lacks sufficient bandwidth for this QoS STA
  MISSING_ACKS: 34 # Disassociated because excessive number of frames need to be acknowledged, but are not acknowledged due to AP transmissions and/or poor channel conditions

  TIMEOUT: 39 # Requested from peer STA due to timeout
  PEERKEY_MISMATCH: 45 # Peer STA does not support the requested cipher suite
  PEER_INITIATED: 46 # In a DLS Teardown frame: The teardown was initiated by the DLS peer In a Disassociation frame: Disassociated because authorized access limit reached
  AP_INITIATED: 47 # In a DLS Teardown frame: The teardown was initiated by the AP In a Disassociation frame: Disassociated due to external service requirements
