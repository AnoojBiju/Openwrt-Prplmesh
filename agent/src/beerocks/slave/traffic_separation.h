/*
 * When defining the bridge with "vlan_filtering", the bridge becomes VLAN aware.
 * If the bridge is VLAN aware, then it is possible to define VLAN policy to each bridged interface.
 * A single interface can support multiple VLAN policies, one for each VLAN ID allowed on that
 * interface.
 * Two VLAN policies that can be defined on an interface:
 * 1. "PVID" -              Any untagged frames coming from the network (external to the switch)
 *                          will be assigned to the configured VLAN.
 *                          Only one VID can be defined as PVID, therefore, if changing the VLAN ID
 *                          with the PVID policy, it will remove the PVID policy of the previous
 *                          PVID VLAN automatically.
 * 
 * 2. "Egress Untagged" -   Any Egress frame sent to the network, will be stripped from the
 *                          configured VLAN tag.
 * 
 * If a frame with a VLAN tag is entering an interface, but the interface is not assigned to the
 * VLAN ID of the frame, the frame will be dropped.
 * 
 * An interface can be defined either as "Tagged Port" or "Untagged Port".
 * Tagged Port -    A port is a "Tagged Port" when an interface is expecting frames containing VLAN
 *                  tags. An example of this is when two switches are connected and pass tagged
 *                  traffic. The sender will send a frame with a VLAN tag. The receiving switch will
 *                  see the VLAN tags, and if the VLAN is allowed, it will forward the frame as
 *                  required.
 *                  
 *                  Although a Tagged Port should receive tagged frames, it can also receive
 *                  untagged frames. When a Tagged Port receives untagged frames, it assumes they
 *                  belong to the Primary VLAN, so it will add the Primary VLAN ID to these frames. 
 * 
 *                  A tagged port shall be defined as "PVID, Untagged Egress" on the Primary VLAN of
 *                  the network and add all the secondary VLANs (Not "PVID" and not
 *                  "Egress Untagged").
 * 
 * Untagged Port -  An untagged port, connects to network clients. A network client is unaware of
 *                  any VLAN configuration. A connected client sends its traffic without any VLAN
 *                  tag on the frames.
 *                  When the frame reaches the Untagged port on a switch, the switch will add the
 *                  VLAN tag. The switch port is configured with a VLAN ID that it will put into the
 *                  tag.
 *                  When a frame leaves an untagged port, the switch strips the VLAN tag from the
 *                  frame.
 * 
 *                  An Untagged Port shall be defined as "PVID, Untagged Egress" on as single VLAN
 *                  ID - The Primary VLAN or one of the Secondary VLANs.
