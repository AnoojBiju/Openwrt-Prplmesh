# Introduction

prplMesh can be configured through different options.
Depending on the platform, those options are set in different ways (see [Platform-specific files](#Platform-specific-files)).

For most platforms, changes in options are only taken into account after prplMesh is restarted.

To change settings at runtime without restarting prplMesh, see also [Configuration via NBAPI](https://gitlab.com/prpl-foundation/prplmesh/prplMesh/-/wikis/prplMesh-Northbound-API#configuration-via-nbapi)

## All options

For each platform, a default configuration file is provided.

Some optional options are not included in default configuration files, and instead have default values within prplMesh.
When a platform-specific configuration file specifies a value for a option, it overrides the default value used by prplMesh.

The tables in the sections below outlines all the existing options, across all platforms.

### Global configuration options

In the following table, "default" means default value used within prplMesh if it's not provided by the platform.

### Radio-specific configuration options (UCI only).

In addition to the global configuration options, prplMesh needs to have one configuration section per radio.
The available options of the radio sections are described in the table that follows.

Again, "default" means default value used within prplMesh if it's not provided by the platform.

| Option                  | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|--------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| hostap_iface            | string | yes      | *none*  | One of the (AP) interface name of the radio. For MaxLinear devices, this must be the "radio interface" (i.e. the dummy interface). |
| sta_iface               | string | yes      | *none*  | The station interface to use for this radio.                                                                                       |
| hostap_iface_steer_vaps | string | yes      | *none*  | The interfaces (VAP) that the client can be steered to. If empty, clients can be steered to any VAP (see optimal path task).       |

## Platform-specific files

### Linux builds (dummy)

For the "dummy" variant, the prplMesh options are set in the `prplmesh_platform_db` file.

This file is composed of key and values, separated by an equal sign (`=`).
Trailing whitespace and whitespace at the beginning of a line is removed.
When a number sign (`#`) is encountered, everything that follows until the end of the line is ignored (it can thus be used to include comments in the file).

A default version of the file is included in this repository: `framework/platform/bpl/platform_db/prplmesh_platform_db`).

The following variables are specific to Linux builds:
| Option                                    | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| hostapd_ctrl_path_<interface_name>        | string | yes      | *none*  | Path to the hostapd's control sockets.        |
| wpa_supplicant_ctrl_path_<interface_name> | string | yes      | *none*  | Path to the wpa_supplicant's control sockets. |

### RDK-B builds

For RDK-B, a `prplmesh_db` file is used.

Unlike for dummy builds, this file is configured at build time using CMAKE options.

The default version is in `framework/platform/bpl/db/uci/prplmesh_db.in`.

The format of this file is the same format as for OpenWrt's UCI options (see prplWrt builds below).

### prplWrt builds

For prplWrt, the [standard UCI system](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/uci) is used.

A default configuration file also exists, and it's stored [alongside the prplMesh package in the prpl feed](https://gitlab.com/prpl-foundation/prplwrt/feed-prpl/-/blob/prplwrt/prplmesh/files/etc/uci-defaults/prplmesh).
