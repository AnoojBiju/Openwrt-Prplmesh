1 (Local) common/beerocks/bcl/source/beerocks_logging.cpp:77 SV.CODE_INJECTION.SHELL_EXEC (3:Warning) Ignore
function 'system' possibly accepts command line that may be influenced by user, causing execution of arbitrary code. Arbitrary commands can be executed by an attacker. Check the length and content of strings used for command execution.

2 (Local) common/beerocks/bcl/source/beerocks_logging.cpp:77 SV.FIU.PROCESS_VARIANTS (4:Review) Ignore
It is easy to run arbitrary commands through environment variables.  Use fork, execve, and pipes instead.
