    Commands from LOG_COMMANDS are executed, and the results are saved
    in individual files (one file per command).

    It is assumed that the device is accessible over serial at
    /dev/device_name.
    Note that a udev rule can be used to create a symlink pointing to
    the right serial device.

    The logs to capture are defined statically in this file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    device
        The device to configure.
    path
        The path to save the log files to. If it doesn't exist, it
        will be created.
